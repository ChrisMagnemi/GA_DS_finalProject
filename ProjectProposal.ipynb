So I'm going to use NLP on the news headlines to come up with a bunch of numeric predictors like sentiment analysis, term frequency, counts of terms in certain categories like political, social, technology. Then I'll do some type of regression to hopefully predict the change in price of the Dow and make a bunch of money. To evaluate I'll use common regression indicators R^2, adj R^2, MSE."
